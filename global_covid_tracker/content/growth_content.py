        "country over a period of time. Measuring growth in this manner makes "
        "comparisons from one country to another difficult as larger "
        "countries tend to have a larger number of new cases or deaths. To "
        "better allow for comparisons across countries, two measures of "
        "growth have been chosen. To calculate a percent increase in the "
        "number of cases or deaths, the difference in the cumulative number "
        "of cases or deaths between today and last week is divided by the "
        "number of cases or deaths from last week. Alternatively, "
        "the difference in the cumulative number of cases *per million* "
        "between last week and today provides a way to compare countries "
        "whose populations vary."
